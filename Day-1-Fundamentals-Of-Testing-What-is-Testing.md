## 1.1. What is Testing? 
<mark> Software testing is a set of activities to discover defects and evaluate the quality of software artifacts <mark/>

*The ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 standard provides further information about software testing concepts.* <br/>
**Testing may be dynamic or static.**
- Dynamic Testing involves execution of software. (Dynamic testing uses different types of test techniques and test approaches to derive test cases)
- Static testing inludes reviews and analysis.

- Evaluating work products such as requirements, user story, designs, and code.
- Trigger failures and finding defects
- Ensuring required coverage of the test object.
- Reducing the level of risk of inadequate software quality.
- Verifing whether specified requirements have been fulfilled.
- Verifing that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements.
- Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions.
- Building confidence in the quality of the test object
- Validating whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders.

**Question #2 (1 Point) (1.1.2.501)**

Which of the following statements BEST describes the difference between testing and debugging? (c)

a)  When dynamic testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with removing it.
