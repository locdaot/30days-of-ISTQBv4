## 1.1. What is Testing? 
<mark> Software testing is a set of activities to discover defects and evaluate the quality of software artifacts <mark/>

*The ISO/IEC/IEEE 29119-1 standard provides further information about software testing concepts.* <br/>
**Testing may be dynamic or static.**
- Dynamic Testing involves execution of software. (Dynamic testing uses different types of test techniques and test approaches to derive test cases)
- Static testing inludes reviews and analysis.

### Software testing is the act of examining the artifacts and behavior of the software under test by verification and validation
> Verification (is Static Testing):
>  **ARE WE BUILDING THE PRODUCT RIGHT**? (ĐÚNG - specifications are correctly implemented by the system)

**Activities involved in verification:**
1. Inspections
2. Reviews
3. Walkthroughs
4. Desk-checking
> Validation (is Dynamic Testing):
> **ARE WE BUILDING THE RIGHT PRODUCT?** (PHÙ HỢP - the user needs)

**Activities involved in vadation:**
1. Black-box Testing
2. White-box Testing
3. Unit Testing
4. Integration Testing

### 1.1.1. Test Objectives
![napkin-selection-4](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/14e92c11-1eb2-43dd-bee5-99c09969012d)

- Evaluating work products such as requirements, user story, designs, and code.
- Trigger failures and finding defects
- Ensuring required coverage of the test object.
- Reducing the level of risk of inadequate software quality.
- Verifing whether specified requirements have been fulfilled.
- Verifing that a test object complies with contractual, legal, and regulatory requirements.
- Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions.
- Building confidence in the quality of the test object
- Validating whether the test object is complete and works as expected by the stakeholders.

# QUESTIONS

**Question #1 (1 Point) (1.1.1.306)**

Which of the following is USUALLY stated as a testing objective? (b)

a) Start testing only when the developers deploy a stable build to the testing environment

b) Providing information to stakeholders to allow them to make informed decisions

c) To validate that there are no unexplored input combinations, as all have been tested

d) Prioritize defect reports and insist to include them into the next release scope.

**Question #2 (1 Point) (1.1.2.501)**

Which of the following statements BEST describes the difference between testing and debugging? (c)

a)  When dynamic testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with removing it.

b) When static testing identifies a failure, debugging is concerned with removing it.

c) When static testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with removing it.

d) When static testing identifies a defect, debugging is concerned with production for the defect, diagnosis, and eliminating it.
