Why is Testing necessary?

1.2.1 Testing's Contributions to success

1.2.2 Testing and Quality Assurance(QA)

QA and QC are not the same

QC is a product-oriented (-oriented combining form /ɔːrientɪd/ (hướng tới), corrective approach that focuses on those activies supporting the achievement of appropriate levels of quality.

===>> defects

QA is a process-oriented, preventive approach that focuses on the implementation and improvement of processes.

===>> Provide feedback on how well the development and test processes are performing.

1.2.3. Errors, Defects, Failures, and Root Causes

Root cause

● A root cause is a fundamental reason for the occurrence of a problem (e.g., a situation that leads to an error).

● Examples: time pressure, inexperienced or insufficiently skilled project participants, miscommunication between project participants, including
miscommunication about requirements and design, complexity of the code, design, architecture, the underlying problem to be solved, and/or the
technologies used, new, unfamiliar technologies etc.

● Defects can be analyzed to identify their root causes, so as to reduce the occurrence of similar defects in the future.

Defect (bug, fault)

Failure

● An error (mistake) is a Human action that produces an incorrect result

● Examples: The developer of the system forgot to rename variables after a cut-and-paste operation; the mistaken thinking that resulted in putting the
defect in the code; product owner making an error while writing the user story

● Humans are fallible beings; Human beings make errors (mistakes) which produce defects (faults, bugs)

● A defect (bug, fault) is an imperfection or deficiency in a work product where it does not meet its requirements or specifications.

● Defects can be found in documentation, such as a requirements specification or a test script, in source code, or in a supporting artifact such as a build
file

● Examples: the improper calculation in the code, such as incorrectly coded logic that checks the upper boundary of an input variable or unnecessary
code that sounds an alarm when reversing was included in the system; Ambiguous user story; The design specification for the system wrongly states
speeds

● A failure is An event in which a component or system does not perform a required function within specified limits.

● If a defect in code is executed, the system may fail to do what it should do, or do something it shouldn’t, causing a failure.

● Some defects will always result in a failure if executed, while others will only result in a failure in specific circumstances, and some may never result
in a failure.

● Failures can also be caused by environmental conditions, such as when radiation or electromagnetic field cause defects in firmware.
