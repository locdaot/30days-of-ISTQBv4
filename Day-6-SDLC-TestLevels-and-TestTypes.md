> :octocat: Test levels are group of test activities related to quality characteristics and most of those test activities can be peformed at every test level
## 2.2.1 TEST LEVELS
In the syllabus, the following five test levels are described:<br/>
1. **Component Testing(unit testing)**  *focuses on testing components in isolation. Component testing is nomarlly performed by developers in their development evironment*<br/>
2. **Component Integration Testing** *focuses on testing the interfaces and interactions between components. Component integration testing is heavily dependent on the integration strategy approaches like bottom-up, top-down, bigbang*<br/>
3. **System Testing** *focuses on the overall behavior and capabilities if an entire system or product, often including functional testing of E2E tasks and the non-functional testing of quality characteristics.*<br/>
4. **System integration Testing** *focuses on testing interfaces of the system under test and other systems and external services. System integration testing requires suitable test environments preferably similar to the operational environment* <br/>
5. **Acceptance Testing** *focuses on validation and on demonstrating readiness for deploy, which means that the system fulfills the user's business needs. The main forms of acceptance testing are: user acceptance testing (UAT),
operational acceptance testing, contractual and regulatory acceptance testing, alpha testing, and beta testing.*<br/>

## 2.2.2 TEST TYPES
A lot of test types exist and can be applied in projects. In this syllabus, the following four test types are addressed:
1. **Functional Testing** *evaluates the functionals that a component or system should perform. The functions are "what" the test object should do. The main objective of functional testing is checling the functional completeness, functional correctness and functional appropriatateness.*
2. **Non-functional Testing** *evaluates attributes other than functional chtacteristics of a component or system. Non-functional testing is the testing of “how well the system behaves”. The main objective of non-functional testing is checking the non-functional software quality characteristics.* 
3. **Black-box Testing** *is specification-based and derives tests from documentation external to the test object. The main object of black-box testing is checking the system's behavior against its specifications.*
4. **Black-box Testing** *is specification-based and derives tests from system's implementation or internal structure. The main object of white-box testing is to cover the underlying structure by the tests to the acceptable level..*
