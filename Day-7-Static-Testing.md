## 3.1 STATIC TESTING BASICs
> In static testing software under test does not need to be executed. Static testing can be applied for both verification and validation.
### 3.1.1 Work products examninable by Static Testing
Almost any work product can be examined using static testing.
Include requirement specification documents, source code, test plans, test cases, product backlog items, test charters, project documentation, contracts and modules.
### 3.1.2 Value of Static Testing
Static testing can detect defects in the earlier phases of the SDLC, fulfilling the principle of early testing.
### 3.1.3 Differences between statis testing and dynamic Testing
[Refer](Day-1-Fundamentals-Of-Testing-What-is-Testing.md)

## 3.2 FEEDBACK AND REVIEW PROCESS
### 3.2.1 Benefitd of early and frequent stakeholder feedback
Early and frequent feedback allows for the early communication of potential qulity problems.
### 3.2.2 Review Process Activities
1. **Planning**: During the planning phase, the scope of the review, which comprises the purpose, the work product to be reviewed, quality characterstics to be evaluated, areas to focus on, exit criteria, supporting information such as standards, effort and the timeframes for the review, shall be refined
2. **Review initiation**: The goal is to make sure that everyone and everything involved is prepared to start the review.
3. **Individual review**: Every reviewer performs an individual review to assess the quality of the work product under review, and to identify anomalies, recommendations, and questions by applying one or more review techniques (e.g., checklist-based reviewing, scenario-based reviewing).
4. **Communication and analysis**: For every anomaly, the decision should be made on its status, ownership and required actions. This is typically done in a review meeting, during which the partipipants also decide what the quality level of reviewed work product is and what follow-up actions are required
5. **Fixing and reporting**: For every defect, a defect report should be created so that corrective actions can be follow-up. On the exit criteria are reached, the work product can be accepted. The review results are reported.
### 3.2.3 Roles and Responsibilities in reviews
- **Manager**: decides what is to be reviewed and provides resources, such as staff and time for review
- **Author**: creates and fixes the work product under review
- **Moderator**: Ensures the effecttive running of review meetings, including mediation, time management, and a safe review environment in which everyone can speak freely
- **Scribe**(alse known as recorder): Collates anomalies from reviews ans record review information
- **Reviewer**: perform review, a reviewer may be someone on the project, a subject matter expert, or any other stakeholder
- **Reviewer leader**: takes overall responsibility for the review such as deciding who will be involved, and organizing when and where the review will take place.
### 3.2.4 Review Types
Some commonly used review types are:
- **Informal review**: Informal review do not follow a defined process and do not require a formal document output. The main objective is detecting animalies.
- **Walkthrough**: A walkthrough, which is led by the author, can serve many objects, such as evaluating quality and building confidence in the work product
- **Technical review**: A technical review is performed by technically qualified reviewers and led by a moderator. The objectives of a technical review are to gain consensus and make decisions regarding a technical problem, but also to detect anomalies, evaluate quality and build confidence in the work product, generate new ideas, and to motivate and enable authors to improve.
- **Inspection**: In inspections, the author cannot act as the review leader or scribe.
### 3.2.5 Success Factors for Reviews
- Defining clear objectives and measurable exit criteria. Evaluation of participants should never bean objective
- Choosing the appropriate review type to achieve the given objectives, and to suit the type of workproduct, the review participants, the project needs and context
- Conducting reviews on small chunks, so that reviewers do not lose concentration during an individual review and/or the review meeting (when held)
- Providing feedback from reviews to stakeholders and authors so they can improve the product and their activities (see section 3.2.1)
- Providing adequate time to participants to prepare for the review
- Support from management for the review process
- Making reviews part of the organizationâ€™s culture, to promote learning and process improvement
- Providing adequate training for all participants so they know how to fulfil their role
- Facilitating meetings
